## About the underlying standards and tools

### Genericode

[Genericode](https://docs.oasis-open.org/codelist/genericode/v1.0/genericode-v1.0.html), also known as Code List Representation, is “a single semantic model for code lists and accompanying XML serialization that is designed to IT-enable and standardize the publication of machine-readable code list information and its interchange between systems”[^1]. Genericode is developed by the [Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS)](https://www.oasis-open.org/). See the [website of the OASIS Code List Representation TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/codelist/) for more information.
